# Knowledge Base Refactoring Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the MindRoot Knowledge Base system with the following key changes:

1. Switch to ChromaDB for vector indices
2. Refactor CSV functionality into a separate file
3. Add a vector index for metadata in addition to the main text index
4. Implement row addition/deletion functionality that maintains integrity

## Implementation Progress

### 1. CSV Handler Implementation ✅

Created a new file `csv_handler.py` that contains all CSV-related functionality:
- Moved CSV document handling from kb.py to this dedicated class
- Added metadata indexing support
- Implemented soft deletion for rows (marking as deleted rather than removing)
- Added support for syncing CSV documents

### 2. ChromaDB Integration ✅

Modified the KB class to use ChromaDB for vector storage:
- Added ChromaDB client initialization
- Created separate collections for text and metadata
- Updated index creation and loading logic
- Added migration functionality for backward compatibility

### 3. Metadata Vector Index ✅

Added a separate vector index for metadata:
- Created metadata encoding function
- Implemented metadata document creation
- Added metadata indexing during document addition
- Updated retrieval to search across both indices

### 4. Row Addition/Deletion ✅

Implemented row operations that maintain integrity:
- Added soft deletion for rows (marking as deleted rather than removing)
- Updated CSV handler to maintain metadata index
- Ensured row numbers/IDs remain consistent

### 5. Updated mod.py ✅

Updated mod.py to use the new CSV handler and ChromaDB features:
- Added new service for CSV document handling
- Updated query_kb command to use metadata search
- Updated enrich_with_kb pipe to use metadata search

## Summary of Changes

1. **CSV Handler**
   - Created dedicated class for CSV operations
   - Implemented metadata indexing for CSV rows
   - Added soft deletion for rows

2. **ChromaDB Integration**
   - Replaced default vector store with ChromaDB
   - Created separate collections for text and metadata
   - Added migration functionality

3. **Metadata Indexing**
   - Added metadata encoding function
   - Created separate index for metadata
   - Implemented combined search across indices

4. **Row Operations**
   - Implemented soft deletion
   - Updated CSV handler for row operations
   - Maintained index integrity

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the refactored system with various document types
   - Verify metadata search functionality
   - Test CSV operations
   - Verify backward compatibility

2. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect new features
   - Add examples for metadata search
   - Document CSV handler usage

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize ChromaDB usage
   - Optimize metadata indexing
   - Improve search performance
